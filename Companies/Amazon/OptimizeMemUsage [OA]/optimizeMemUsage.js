/**
 Give a computer with total K memory space, and an array of foreground tasks and background tasks the computer need
 to do. Write an algorithm to find a pair of tasks from each array to maximize the memory usage. Notice the tasks could be done without origin order.

 Input
 The input to the function/method consists of three arguments :
 foregroundTask, an array representing the memory usage of the foreground tasks,
 backgroundTask, an array representing the memory usage of the background tasks,
 K, the total memory space of the computer.

 Output
 Return a list of pairs of the task ids.

 Examples 1
     Input:
     foregroundTasks = [1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 6]
     backgroundTasks = [3, 1, 2]
     K = 6

     Output:
     [(3, 2), (4, 1)]

     Explanation:
     Here we have 5 foreground tasks: task 0 uses 1 memeory. task 1 uses 7 memeory. task 2 uses 2 memeory..
     And 5 background tasks: task 0 uses 3 memeory. task 1 uses 1 memeory. task 2 uses 2 memeory..
     We need to find two tasks with total memory usage sum <= K.
     So we find the foreground task 3 and background task 2. Total memory usage is 6.
     And the foreground task 4 and background task 1. Total memory usage is also 6.

 Examples 2
     Input:
     foregroundTasks = [1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 6]
     backgroundTasks = [3, 1, 2]
     K = 10

     Output:
     [(1, 2))]

     Explanation:
     Here we find the foreground task 1 and background task 2. Total memory usage is 7 + 2 = 9, which is < 10.

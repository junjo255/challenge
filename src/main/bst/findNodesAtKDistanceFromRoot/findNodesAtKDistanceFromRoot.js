Find Nodes at 'K' Distance From the Root

Problem Statement #
Implement a function findKNodes(root,k) that finds and returns nodes
at k distance from the root in the given binary tree.
An illustration is also provided for your understanding.

Input #
The root node of a BST and any number k

Output #
Returns all nodes in a stringed list format which are at k distance from the root node

Sample Input #
    bst = {
        6 -> 4,9
        4 -> 2,5
        9 -> 8,12
        12 -> 10,14
    }
where parent -> leftChild,rightChild
k = 2

Sample Output #

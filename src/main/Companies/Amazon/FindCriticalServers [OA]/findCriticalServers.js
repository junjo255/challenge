/**
 Find Critical Servers ⭐⭐⭐ Hard
 Given an undirected graph, find out all the vertices when removed will make the graph disconnected.
 Initially the graph is connected.

 For example given the graph below:  Checkout the picture

 Return [3, 6]. Because we can make the graph disconnected by removing either vertex 3 or vertex 6.

 Input:
     - nodeNum, the total count of vertices in the graph. Each vertex has an unique id in
        the range from 0 to nodeNum - 1 inclusive.
     - edges, a list of integer pairs representing all the edges on the graph.

 output:
     - A list of integers representing the ids of the articulation points.

 example:
    Input:
         nodeNum = 7
         edges = [[0,1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 5], [5, 6], [3,4]]

    Output: [2,3,5]
